# PyFiPoreStat
This software package processes SEM micrographs of sectioned particles in FIJI to identify and get data on internal pores and python code is used to bin the data by particle size.
This codeset has been used to process data published in articles:
- "Valluri, S.K., Dreizin, E.L., and Dlott, D.D., Porosity : The key to initiating metallic composite particles under shock compression. AIP Conf. Proc., 2023. 2844 (1) : 300022."
- "Valluri, S.K., Salvati III L., Dreizin E.L., and Dlott D.D., Fast Reactions of Shocked Energetic Microporous Metallic Composites. Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics , 2023,48, e202300031"

Typical cross-sectioned particle micrographs:
